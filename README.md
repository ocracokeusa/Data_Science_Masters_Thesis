Comprehensive Analysis of the future price of NBA Top Shot moments
NBA Top Shot moments are NFTs built on the FLOW blockchain and created by Dapper Labs in collaboration with the NBA. These NFTs, commonly referred to as “moments”, consist of in-game highlights of an NBA or WNBA player. Using the different variables of a moment, like for example: the type of play done by the player appearing in the moment (dunk, assist, block, etc.), the number of listings of that moment in the marketplace, whether the player appearing in the moment is a rookie or the rarity tier of the moment (Common, Fandom, Rare or Legendary). This project aims to provide a statistical analysis that could yield hidden correlations of the characteristics of a moment and its price, and a prediction of the price of moments with the use of machine learning regression models which include linear regression, random forest or neural networks. As NFTs, and especially NBA Top Shot, are a relatively recent area of research, at the moment there is not extensive research performed about this area. This research has an intent to expand the up to date analysis and research performed in this topic and serve as a foundation for any future research in this area, as well as provide helpful and practical information about the valuation of moments, the importance of the diverse characteristics of moments and impact in the pricing of the moments and the future possible application of this information to other similar highlight-oriented sport NFTs like NFL AllDay or UFC Strike, which are designed similarly to NBA Top Shot.
